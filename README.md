## About Me

I'm currently honing my programming skills as a 2nd-year Information Systems student at Bicol University. I have solid foundational knowledge in **C++** and am actively expanding my expertise in **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery**. I’m eager to dive into **PHP** and **JavaScript** soon to broaden my full-stack development capabilities.

While I admit I can be a bit laid-back at times, I always deliver quality work and meet my goals with determination and focus.
